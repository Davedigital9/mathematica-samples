# mathematica-samples
This repository contain some files showcasing the computational capabilities of Mathematica

Each of them, and more to come, showcase the mathematical aspects of Mathematica.

There is one file on the analysis of a supermarket sales dataset. Currently, I am researching and learning about the functions Mathematica is capable of. As such, I intend to further improve this project in a sepearate repository in the nearest future. I would appreciate any contributions to this project.
